    "\n",
    "A consistent coding style helps others (including our future selves) read and understand code more easily. Code is read much more often than it is written, and as the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020) states, “Readability counts”. Python proposed a standard style through one of its first Python Enhancement Proposals (PEP), [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some points worth highlighting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- document your code and ensure that assumptions, internal algorithms, expected inputs, expected outputs, etc., are clear\n",
    "- use clear, semantically meaningful variable names\n",
    "- use white-space, _not_ tabs, to indent lines (tabs can cause problems across different text editors, operating systems, and version control systems)\n"

    "- [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008): a style guide for Python that discusses topics such as how to name variables, how to indent your code, how to structure your import statements, etc. Adhering to PEP8 makes it easier for other Python developers to read and understand your code, and to understand what their contributions should look like.\n",
    "- The Black code formatter can automatically format your code to conform to PEP8 and is available as an extension for VS Code.\n",
    "- Some groups and organizations follow different style guidelines besides PEP8. For example, the [Google style guide on Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) makes slightly different recommendations. Google wrote an application that can help you format your code in either their style or PEP8 called [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf/).\n",
    "- With respect to coding style, the key is _consistency_. Choose a style for your project be it PEP8, the Google style, or something else and do your best to ensure that you and anyone else you are collaborating with sticks to it. Consistency within a project is often more impactful than the particular style used. A consistent style will make your software easier to read and understand for others and for your future self.\n"
