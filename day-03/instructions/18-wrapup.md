# Wrap-up

## Questions
- What have we learned?
- What else is out there and where do I find it?

## Objectives
- Name and locate scientific Python community sites for software, workshops, and help.

> Leslie Lamport once said, “Writing is nature’s way of showing you how sloppy your thinking is.” The same is true of programming: many things that seem obvious when we’re thinking about them turn out to be anything but when we have to explain them precisely.

## Python supports a large and diverse community across academia and industry.

- The [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) covers the core language and the standard library.

- [PyCon](https://pycon.org/) is the largest annual conference for the Python community.

- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) is a rich collection of scientific utilities. It is also the name of a [series of annual conferences](https://conference.scipy.org/).

- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is the home of Project Jupyter.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is the home of the Pandas data library.

- Stack Overflow’s [general Python section](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python?tab=Votes) can be helpful, as well as the sections on [NumPy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy?tab=Votes), [SciPy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scipy?tab=Votes), and [Pandas](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas?tab=Votes).
- Generative AI tools (e.g. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)) can be very helpful to draft or debug your code. Just remember to treat any generated code as a suggestion that you need to carefully review and understand before using it in your project!

## Key points
- Python supports a large and diverse community across academia and industry.
