# Software Carpentry: Plotting and Programming in Python

Materials for Dartmouth's iteration of the Software Carpentry workshop on Python programming.

## Contents
The workshop materials are organized for three days. Each day contains the following directories:
- `instructions`: Contains Jupyter notebooks with notes for each lesson
- `my_code`: This is the suggested place to hold the notebooks you create while following the code-along sessions
- `exercises`: Contains exercises accompanying each lesson
- `solutions`: Contains solutions to the respective exercises

There is also a directory called `data` that contains various CSV files used in the lessons.
