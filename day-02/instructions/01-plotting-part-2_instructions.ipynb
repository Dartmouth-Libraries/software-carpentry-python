Use the `fontsize` parameter in `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `title`, and `legend`, and [`tick_params` with `labelsize`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick_params.html) to increase the text size of the numbers on your axes.\n",

For lines, the `linestyle` parameter lets you use different types of lines. For scatterplots, `marker` lets you change the shape of your points. If you’re unsure about your colors, you can use [coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) or [color oracle](https://colororacle.org/) to simulate what your plots would look like to those with colorblindness.\n"
